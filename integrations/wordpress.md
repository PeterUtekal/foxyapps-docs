## How to Embed a FoxyApp into Your WordPress Website

**Please note:** To follow this guide, you should have administrative access to your WordPress site.

# 1. Log in to Your WordPress Dashboard
- Go to your WordPress login page. Usually it looks like this: `http://yourwebsite.com/wp-login.php`.
- Enter your username and password.

# 2. Create or Edit a Page/Post
- Navigate to `Pages` or `Posts` in the left-hand side menu.
- Click `Add New` to create a new page or post. Alternatively, click `Edit` under an existing page or post where you want to embed the iFrame.

# 3. Switch to the Text Editor
- In the page or post editor, switch from the Visual editor to the Text editor. You can do this by clicking on the `Text` tab on the upper right side of the editor area.

# 4. Paste the iFrame Code
- Copy the iFrame code from FoxyApps platform.
- Paste the iFrame code in the desired location within the Text editor.

Your iFrame code should look something like this:

    <iframe src="https://www.foxyapps.com/path/to/your/embed" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Remember to adjust the `width`, `height`, and `src` attributes as needed.

# 5. Preview the Page/Post
- Click the `Preview` button on the upper right side of the page to ensure the iFrame appears correctly.

# 6. Publish or Update the Page/Post
- If everything looks fine, click the `Publish` or `Update` button to save your changes.

**Please note** that some WordPress themes or plugins may not support iFrames. In such a case, you might need to use a plugin that allows iFrame embedding.
